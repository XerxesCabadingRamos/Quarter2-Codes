1. Grocery List Scenario:
Imagine you’re maintaining a grocery list using an array. How would you use built-in methods to:

Add a new item to the end of the list?
- I'd use .append

Remove the last item from the list?
- I'd use .pop

Find the position of a specific item?
- I'd use .index


2. Playlist Management:

If you're building a music app that manages playlists using arrays, how can built-in methods like sort() or reverse() help enhance the user experience?
 - sort() helps keep things organized however the user would like
 - reverse() could be useful in reversing said organization


3. Daily Schedule Organizer:
Your daily schedule is stored as an array of tasks. Which built-in array methods would help you:

Reorder tasks by priority?
 - sort()
Remove a cancelled task?
 - remove("")
Insert a new task in a specific time slot?
 - .insert(x, "")


4. Friend List in a Social App:

You want to find if a person is already in your friend list and add them only if they’re not. Which built-in method could help you achieve this, and how?

friends = ["Friend1", "Friend2", "Friend3"]

new_friend = str(input("Please input Friend name: "))

if new_friend not in friends:
    friends.append(new_friend)

print(friends)
